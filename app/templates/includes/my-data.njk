          <h2>What is consent and how does it work?</h2>
          <p>It is essential that all participants in the Train for the Brain study agree to take part of their own volition, and indicate that they understand what the study involves. There is no obligation to take part. Once you have provided consent you can withdraw from the study at any time.</p>
